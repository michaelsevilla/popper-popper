\section{Conclusion}

We have outlined the structure of our Popper-compliant papers and showed the
complexity of a reproducible experiment. We iterated to a Popper-compliant
paper-writing process after encountering numerous pitfalls, which we have
documented and used to shape our best practices. While our process will never
be perfect, we are encouraged with the improved speed and ease that our research
progresses now that we have: (1) made reproducibility a 1st class citizen, (2)
defined collaboration rules, and (3) made it a priority to maintain pointers.
We hope that our call-to-arms for community cooperation effectively improves
the state of reproducibility in software research artifacts.
