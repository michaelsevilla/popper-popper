\section{Popper-compliant Papers}

% what papers have we done
We have authored five Popper-compliant papers:
\begin{itemize}

\item quiho: Automated Performance Regression Testing Using Inferred
Resource Utilization Profiles

\item Cudele: An API and Framework for Programmable Consistency and
Durability in a Global Namespace

\item Malacology: A Programmable Storage System

\item Characterizing and Reducing Cross-Platform Performance Using
OS-level Virtualization

\end{itemize}

\section{Reproducibility Must Be a 1st Class Citizen}
% exploration vs. complete
% cross-cluster compatibility 
%  - inventory files hard coded throughout tree
%  - configuration files not propagated for experiments
%  - visualize files pulled data from hard coded paths
%  - graphs not created automatically
% why Mantle failed

\section{Organized Repositories and Documentation}
%cause the most work
% role of git
% docker images saved in internal registry (buildding)

\section{Well-Defined Collaboration Roles}
% keeping organization
% workflows

\section{Maintaining Pointers}
% wary of ephemeral links

% large code bases large code bases (src, deploy)

% different registry hubs (Docker, GitHub)

\section{Conference Requirements}
% double blinded??
