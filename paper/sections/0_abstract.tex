We describe the four publications we have tried to make reproducible and
discuss how each paper has changed our workflows, practices, and collaboration
policies. The fundamental insight is that paper artifacts must be made
reproducible from the start of the project; published papers and undisciplined
researchers are too difficult to make reproducible.  The best practices adopted
by our research laboratory are sculpted by the pitfalls identified for Popper,
the workflow convention we adopted to provided reproducibility. We conclude
with a ``call-to-arms" for the community focused on enhancing reproducibility
initiatives for academic conferences, industry environments, and national
laboratories. We hope that our experiences will shape a best practices guide
for future reproducible papers.
